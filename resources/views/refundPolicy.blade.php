                <!-- Effective Date -->
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 1, 2024</p>

                <!-- General Terms -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-4">1. General Terms</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Timerr offers a subscription-based service with access to various features, including a free tier and paid plans. Once a user subscribes to a paid plan (such as the Freelancer package), they are billed on a monthly or yearly basis depending on the selected plan.</p>

                <!-- Refunds for Accidental Payments -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-4">2. Refunds for Accidental Payments</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700">If a user accidentally subscribes to a paid plan and contacts support within 24 hours of the transaction, we may issue a full refund. This only applies if the user has not actively used the premium features during this period.</p>

                <!-- No Refunds for Ongoing Subscriptions -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-4">3. No Refunds for Ongoing Subscriptions</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700">After the 24-hour grace period or once the premium features are actively used, refunds will not be issued for the remaining duration of the subscription. Users can cancel their subscription at any time to prevent future billing, but the service will remain available for the current billing cycle.</p>

                <!-- Add-ons and Custom Features -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-4">4. Add-ons and Custom Features</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700">In the future, Timerr will offer additional features, such as purchasing extra clients or custom add-ons. These purchases are non-refundable once activated.</p>

                <!-- Cancellation and Termination -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-4">5. Cancellation and Termination</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Users are free to cancel their subscription at any time through their account settings. The cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period. No pro-rated refunds will be issued for unused portions of the subscription.</p>
